            Nami is the second member to join the Straw Hat Pirates. Initially,
            she traveled alongside Luffy and Zoro but had not yet officially
            become part of the crew. At that time, Nami was part of the Arlong
            Pirates, complicating her situation. Her full commitment to the crew
            came after the Arlong Park arc, when Luffy defeated Arlongâ€”who had
            betrayed her and taken control of her home island, enslaving its
            inhabitants. Arlong's crew was responsible for the death of Nami's
            adoptive mother, which fueled her desire for revenge. Following
            Luffy's victory over Arlong, Nami was finally able to break free
            from her past and officially join the Straw Hat Pirates.

            Sora, took a drug to counteract the modifications, which succeeded
            only for Sanji. As a result, Sanji was seen as a failure by his
            father and bullied by his siblings for being "weak". At age 8 He
            crossed the Red Line to East Blue, where he worked as a cook on a

            Sanji initially refused to join Luffy's crew. The other Baratie
            chefs, including Zeff, convinced Sanji to leave and pursue his dream

            Chopper was originally a reindeer who ate the Human-Human Fruit,
            giving him human intelligence and the ability to transform.He was
            ostracized by both humans and reindeer due to his unusual nature.
            Dr. Hiriluk, a quack doctor, took Chopper in and became his father
            figure, teaching him medicine. After Hiriluk's death, Dr. Kureha
            took Chopper as her apprentice and trained him in medicine.The Straw
            Hats arrived on Drum Island seeking medical help for Nami, who was
            gravely ill.They encountered Chopper while searching for a doctor on
            the island. Initially, Chopper was wary of the pirates, but he was
            intrigued by Luffy's friendly nature and determination.During their
            time on Drum Island, Luffy and the others learned about Chopper's
            past and his dream to become a doctor who can cure any disease.
            Chopper helped treat Nami and assisted the Straw Hats in their
            conflict with Wapol, the tyrannical former king of Drum Island.
            After the battle, Luffy invited Chopper to join the crew as their
            doctor. Chopper was hesitant at first, but with encouragement from
            Dr. Kureha and his own desire to explore the world, he decided to
            join. Chopper came to be the fifth member.

            Robin was the sixth member to join the Straw hats she was born on
            Ohara, an island known for its great library and scholar. At age 8,
            she became an archaeologist and could read Poneglyphs, ancient
            stones containing hidden history. The World Government destroyed
            Ohara to prevent the spread of this forbidden knowledge. Robin
            escaped but was given a bounty, forcing her to live as a fugitive
            from childhood. She joined various criminal organizations to
            survive, ultimately becoming vice president of Baroque Works under
            the alias Miss All Sunday. Robin first encountered the Straw Hats as
            an antagonist during the Alabasta arc. She was working for
            Crocodile, the leader of Baroque Works and main villain of the arc.
            Despite being on opposite sides, Robin helped Luffy escape from a
            sand trap set by Crocodile. After Crocodile's defeat, Robin appeared
            on the Straw Hats' ship, asking to join the crew. Initially, the
            crew was suspicious of Robin due to her past as their enemy.
            However, Luffy accepted her without hesitation, much to the shock of
            his crewmates. Robin's knowledge of Poneglyphs and archaeology
            proved valuable to the crew's journey. Her true loyalty was tested
            and confirmed during the Water 7 and Enies Lobby arcs, where the
            Straw Hats fought against the World Government to save her.

            shipwright who built the Oro Jackson, Gol D. Roger's ship. Franky
            was involved in the construction of the Sea Train and was deeply

            Early Life: Brook was born as a human and became a member of the Rumbar Pirates, a crew known for their love of music. They promised to return to Laboon, a giant whale, after their voyage around the world. Devil Fruit: Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi (Revive-Revive Fruit), which allowed him to come back to life after dying. However, his soul took so long to find his body that by the time it did, he had become nothing but a skeleton. Tragic Fate: The Rumbar Pirates faced tragedy when they were attacked by an enemy crew in the Florian Triangle. Knowing they were doomed, Brook and his crewmates recorded one last song, "Bink's Sake," before they died. Brook first encounters the Straw Hat Pirates during the Thriller Bark arc. The crew initially fears him because he is a talking skeleton. Luffy, however, is intrigued and invites Brook to join them right away. Brook initially declines because his shadow has been stolen by Gecko Moria, preventing him from venturing into sunlight. The Straw Hats help Brook regain his shadow from Moria during their battle on Thriller Bark. After this victory and realizing that Laboon is still alive, Brook decides to join Luffy's crew. He officially becomes the seventh member of the Straw Hat Pirates at the end of the Thriller Bark arc, bringing his skills as a musician and swordsman to the team.

            Early Life: Brook was born as a human and became a member of the Rumbar Pirates, a crew known for their love of music. They promised to return to Laboon, a giant whale, after their voyage around the world. Devil Fruit: Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi (Revive-Revive Fruit), which allowed him to come back to life after dying. However, his soul took so long to find his body that by the time it did, he had become nothing but a skeleton. Tragic Fate: The Rumbar Pirates faced tragedy when they were attacked by an enemy crew in the Florian Triangle. Knowing they were doomed, Brook and his crewmates recorded one last song, "Bink's Sake," before they died. Brook first encounters the Straw Hat Pirates during the Thriller Bark arc. The crew initially fears him because he is a talking skeleton. Luffy, however, is intrigued and invites Brook to join them right away. Brook initially declines because his shadow has been stolen by Gecko Moria, preventing him from venturing into sunlight. The Straw Hats help Brook regain his shadow from Moria during their battle on Thriller Bark. After this victory and realizing that Laboon is still alive, Brook decides to join Luffy's crew. He officially becomes the seventh member of the Straw Hat Pirates at the end of the Thriller Bark arc, bringing his skills as a musician and swordsman to the team.
