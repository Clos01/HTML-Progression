                        Nami is the second member to join the Straw Hat Pirates. Initially, she traveled alongside Luffy and Zoro but had not yet officially become part of the crew. At that time, Nami was part of the Arlong Pirates, complicating her situation.
                        Her full commitment to the crew came after the Arlong Park arc, when Luffy defeated Arlongâ€”who had betrayed her and taken control of her home island, enslaving its inhabitants. Arlong's crew was responsible for the death of Nami's adoptive mother, which fueled her desire for revenge. Following Luffy's victory over Arlong, Nami was finally able to break free from her past and officially join the Straw Hat Pirates.
